# Biography

Hello from the University of Texas at Austin School of Information. In January, 2003, I "came in from the cold," returning to academia after half a lifetime in industry as a usability practitioner and manager. I attend my post enthusiastically, eager to explore the theoretical underpinnings of usability, help develop a new generation of HCI researchers and usability/UX experts, and further promote the design and development of technology that takes into account the capabilities of human users.

I welcome your call, or email, if you want to talk about human information processing, usability practice, usability education, HCI design, cognitive psychology, baseball statistics, or bonefishing on the flats of Biscayne Bay.
