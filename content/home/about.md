# Biography

Greetings.
Hello from the University of Texas at Austin School of Information. In January, 2003, I &quot;came in from the
cold,&quot; returning to academia after half a lifetime in industry as a usability practitioner and manager. For
this one academic year (Fall 2017 - Spring 2018) I will serve as interim dean as we seek our new dean to fill the large
and stylish boots of Andrew Dillon. I attend my post enthusiastically, eager to do what I can to help our
students toward a lifetime of learning and productive work, help our staff enjoy fulfilling careers, help
our faculty maintain their research and teaching excellence, and help the world recognize the multi-
faceted and rich contribution of the Texas iSchool. Personally, as a professor, I wish to continue to
explore the theoretical underpinnings of usability, help develop a new generation of HCI researchers and
usability/UX experts, and further promote the design and development of technology that takes into
account the capabilities of human users.

I welcome your call, or email, if you want to talk about how the iSchool might serve you, or about
human information processing, usability practice, usability education, HCI design, cognitive psychology,
baseball statistics, or bonefishing on the flats of Biscayne Bay.
